# Optimizing Critical Resources and Critical Bytes

## Introduction

To optimize the Critical Rendering Path even more, we need to improve download time - the Network. We just need critical resources.

A **Critical Resource** is a resource that could block initial rendering of the page.

**Critical Bytes** are the total number of bytes required to complete the initial render of the page.

### Optimize Initial Rendering

- Critical Resources
- Critical Bytes

What's the **minimum** amount of resources that we can ship to render the page?

We need to show to user the most important content in the first second or two.

We don't want to wait for all files to be downloaded before we can show something on the screen.
